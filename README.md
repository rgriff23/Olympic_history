# Olympic history 

This repo contains scripts for compiling and analyzing historical data on Olympic athletes from 1896 to 2016, scraped from www.sports-reference.com. 

I uploaded the data to Kaggle where it has been quite popular: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results 

Also published a popular kernel exploring the data visually with R: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/olympic-history-data-a-thorough-analysis

Finally, I wrote a series of blog posts about the project, starting [here](https://rgriff23.github.io/2018/05/27/olympic-history-1-web-scraping.html).
